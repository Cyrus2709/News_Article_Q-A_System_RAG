# News_Article_Q-A_System_RAG
s a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework project that demonstrates how to integrate OpenAI's API and ChromaDB to generate more accurate and context-aware responses. By embedding documents into a vector space, retrieving relevant data, and providing it as context to an LLM (e.g., GPT-3.5-Turbo), this project aims to minimize hallucinations and enhance the reliability of language model outputs.

Features

Document Embedding: Utilizes OpenAI's API to generate embeddings for documents stored in ChromaDB.
Contextual Retrieval: Retrieves the most relevant documents to provide additional context for the LLM.
Improved Accuracy: Reduces hallucinations commonly observed in general-purpose LLMs.
Modular Design: Easily extendable for various use cases involving contextual understanding.
Setup and Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository
git clone <repository_url>
cd contextify
2. Set Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
Note: Ensure you have sufficient OpenAI credits in your account.

3. Create a Virtual Environment
Run the following commands to set up a Python virtual environment:

python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
4. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries using pip:

pip install python-dotenv
pip install openai
pip install chromadb
Usage

Step 1: Embedding Documents
Prepare your documents for embedding. Store the embeddings in ChromaDB for efficient retrieval.

Step 2: Contextual Retrieval
When a query is made, the system retrieves the most relevant documents from ChromaDB based on the embedding similarity.

Step 3: Generate Responses
The retrieved documents are provided as context to the LLM (GPT-3.5-Turbo in this case), generating informed and context-aware responses.

Key Components

OpenAI API: Generates embeddings and LLM-based responses.
ChromaDB: Stores and retrieves document embeddings for context augmentation.
Dotenv: Manages environment variables securely.
Deployment

You can deploy this project locally using the following steps:

Activate the virtual environment:
source env/bin/activate
Run the Python script:
python main.py
Future Enhancements

Integration with other LLMs: Add support for alternative language models like Claude or Llama.
Scalability Improvements: Support for larger datasets with distributed database systems.
Real-Time Deployment: Wrap the RAG framework into an API for live applications.
